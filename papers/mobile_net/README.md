The **MobileNet** is a lightweight architecture, a type of convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. The model architecture is based on
**depthwise separable convolutions** to build lightweight and less computational intensive model that can have low latency for mobile and embedded devices.


This work shows the implementation of the MobileNet architecture from the paper **"MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications"**. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).
