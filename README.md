# MobileNet
**Implemetation of the paper "MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications"**

**MobileNet** is a lightweight and efficient model for mobile and embedded vision applications. **MobileNet** are based on a architecture that uses depthwise seperable convolutions to build lightweight deep neural networks. 

The paper describes an efficient network architecture
and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very
small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the
design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications.
