# Computer Vision Research
Welcome to my **Computer Vision Research** repository! This project is a hub for my journey into the fascinating world of Computer Vision, combining **research**, **experimentation**, and **personal learning**. It covers a wide range of vision tasks such as:

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Image Segmentation
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Video Processing

----
## What's Inside?
1. Notable Research Paper Replication

    - Reimplementation of state-of-the-art models from research papers
    using the PyTorch framework.
    - Simplified training on PyTorch-ready or custom datasets to explore their architecture and functionality.

2. Model Development from Scratch

    - Designing and training deep learning models from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of underlying principles.
    - Training pre-trained deep learning models on custom tasks.

3. Experiments and Fun Projects

    - Personal experiments and hands-on learning to see how things work in practice.

This repository is driven by **curiosity**, a love for exploration, and the belief that learning is **super fun**! If you're just starting in computer vision, I hope this project inspires you as much as it does for me.

Enjoy the journey! ðŸš€
